            <h3 id = "Computer History">Computers: A brief History</h3>
            <p>
                Computers have evolved throughout history; Heres a brief overview of the 
                timeline and changes computers have undergone over the past 200 years

                    <li>
                        <h4>Early Mechanical Computers (1822-1930):</h4>
                        <p>The first computer ever made was The Babbage Difference Engine, designed by Charles Babbage</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Electro-Mechanical Computers (1930)</h4>
                        <p>Some electro-mechanical computers—such as the Differential Analyzer built in 1930—used purely mechanical internals but employed electric motors to power them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Electronic Computers (1940)</h4>
                        <p>The first electronic computers were developed during the World War II, with the earliest of those being the Colossus. The Colossus was developed to decrypt secret German codes during the war. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The first Commercial Computers (1950)</h4>
                        <p>The first commercially available computers came in the 1950s. While computing up until this time had mainly focused on scientific, mathematical, and defense capabilities, new computers were designed for business functions, such as banking and accounting.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Transitor Computers (Mid 1950's)</h4>
                        <p>The development of transistors led to the replacement of vacuum tubes, and resulted in significantly smaller computers. The first disk drive, the IBM 350 RAMAC, was the first of these introduced in 1956.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The Microchip and Microprocessor (1960)</h4>
                        <p>The microchip (or integrated circuit) is one of the most important advances in computing technology. The first processors were 4-bit, but 8-bit models quickly followed by 1972.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Personal Computers (1970)</h4>
                        <p>The first personal computers were built in the early 1970s. Most of these were limited-production runs, and worked based on small-scale integrated circuits and multi-chip CPUs. The Altair 8800 was the first popular computer using a single-chip microprocessor.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The Early Notebooks and Laptops (1980-1990)</h4>
                        <p>One particularly notable development in the 1980s was the advent of the commercially available portable computer. The first of these was the Osborne 1, in 1981. It had a tiny 5″ monitor and was large and heavy compared to modern laptops</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Netbooks (Late 2000's)</h4>
                        <p>Another recent progression in computing history is the development of netbook computers. Netbooks are smaller and more portable than standard laptops, while still being capable of performing most functions average computer users need.</p>
