            <h3>First Review:</h3>
            <p>
                This website was really helpful, it helped inspire me to pursue a carrer in the Artificial intelligence field. Thats why I am giving it a rating of 5/5 stars.

            <h3>Second Review:</h3>
            <p>
                Didn't find much use of the website but was still very intresting learning about all the different areas of Comp Sci and a bunch of its different fields. Thats
                why I'm giving it a rating of 3/5 stars.

            <h3>Third Review:</h3>
            <p>
                Was an intresting website for someone like me that doesn't know about Computer Sciecne or Computers in general. Thats why I'm giving it a rating of 4/5 stars.
